    "Message": "Deep learning has transformed many data analytic applications, such as speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing. DL also made its impact to the security and privacy community, for instance, in network intrusion detection, malware detection, and malicious behavior analysis. Meanwhile, a broad spectrum of cyber-attacks against deep learning systems has been proposed. Such attacks aim to break the integrity or confidentiality of the models. In this talk, I will introduce several research projects from KUâ€™s InfoSec group: (1) AI/DL attack evaluation, (2) a highly-effective and very stealthy neural Trojan, (3) an inversion attack against NLP model sharing, (4) a universal defense mechanism against adversarial ML attacks, and (5) employing deep learning for mobile/IoT device recognition. Through this talk, we hope to highlight the security and privacy issues in AI/DL systems, which may be helpful for audience to identify the opportunities and challenges in their own research fields."
